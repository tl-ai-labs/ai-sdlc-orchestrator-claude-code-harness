/**
 * The zero-touch settings box, in the chat: the hooks around Claude Code's question tool (AskUserQuestion).
 *
 * argv[2] is the moment:
 *   pre-ask     before a box is shown (PreToolUse, AskUserQuestion)
 *   post-ask    after the person answered it (PostToolUse, AskUserQuestion)
 *   prompt      a message the person sent (UserPromptSubmit): start lines that waited for it, the box's steps, and
 *               this chat's facts when the message names zero-touch
 *   pre-any     any other tool, in the first chat after install only (PreToolUse, every tool; the shell script skips
 *               node entirely unless that chat is waiting for its first settings)
 *
 * What it guarantees:
 *   - Only a box about zero-touch is checked (scripts/boxes.mjs isZeroTouchBox). Claude's own questions and the
 *     workflows' approval steps pass untouched.
 *   - A zero-touch box must be exactly the one expected now, word for word: the mode box first; after "Workflows" the
 *     models box; after "Hand-off" the four hand-off questions. Anything else is replaced by the expected box before
 *     the person sees it.
 *   - Only the fixed choices are saved, all or nothing, and only when the sequence is complete (Off completes it at the
 *     first box). The saved settings reach new chats; in the first chat after install they apply at once.
 *   - A helper agent never opens the settings: they belong to the main chat.
 *   - A closed box reaches no hook, so it is noticed at the person's next message; the first
 *     chat's hold ends as soon as the box has been SHOWN, whatever the person then does, so nobody is ever stuck.
 *
 * Records (scripts/chat-files.mjs): zt_setup.json (first chat), zt_flow.json (a sequence in progress), zt_say.json
 * (start lines waiting for the first message). The settings themselves: scripts/settings.mjs. Always exits 0.
