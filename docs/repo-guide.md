# Repo guide

This repository holds `mmo` (Multi-Model Orchestrator) v0.8.5 — a Claude Code plugin that runs a
full software-delivery pipeline against a brief (requirements → design → code → senior review →
tests → security review), routes each phase to the model that fits it, and records what each phase
cost — plus the harness, tests and documentation that ship it.

Two things live here, and telling them apart makes the rest of the layout obvious:

- **The plugin** — everything under `plugin/`. This is what gets installed into Claude Code.
- **The harness around it** — `tools/`, `docs/`, `examples/` and the root manifest. Build scripts,
  the test suite, reference briefs and recorded runs. None of it is installed; it is how the plugin
  is developed and how its results are published.

If you only want to *use* the plugin, [README.md](../README.md) is the shorter road. This page is
for reading or changing the code.

## Top-level layout

| Path | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `plugin/` | The installable plugin: slash commands, subagents, skills, routing policies, the bundled MCP server, the policy console, hooks and scripts. |
| `zero-touch/` | The `zero-touch` plugin: the person's zero-touch settings and the switch. Its start hook (`scripts/start-chat.mjs`) marks each new chat with its mode and models (`scripts/mark.mjs`) and shows the start lines (the summary once per save, then only what needs action; at once in the terminal, with the first message in the desktop app); its settings hooks (`scripts/settings-hook.mjs`, through `hooks/settings.sh`) run the settings box in the chat: the boxes word for word (`scripts/boxes.mjs`), the saved choices in the plugin's own data folder (`scripts/settings.mjs`), every text it shows (`scripts/messages.mjs`), and a copy of mmo's Google check (`scripts/google.mjs`). It holds none of mmo's workflow or hand-off code: everything zero-touch does in a chat is the `mmo` plugin's, in workflow mode and hand-off mode alike. See [ambient-mode.md](ambient-mode.md). |
| `tools/` | Repo-side scripts and the root test suite — setup, cost reporting, log formatting. |
| `docs/` | User and contributor documentation, plus specs, planning notes and recorded walkthroughs. |
| `examples/` | Four project briefs (`unit-convert`, `quick-demo`, `workforce-ops`, `travel-ops`), plus the recorded output of two runs against `quick-demo` — one model-path, one agent-path — under `examples/quick-demo/passes/`. |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | Marketplace manifest that makes this repo installable through `/plugin install`. It lists both plugins, `mmo` and `zero-touch`. |
| `package.json` | Root manifest. Owns `npm test`, `npm run setup`, `npm run report`, `npm run verify`. |
| `README.md` · `SETUP.md` · `CONTRIBUTING.md` · `CLAUDE.md` · `SECURITY.md` | What the plugin does, how to install it, how to contribute, the writing rules, the disclosure policy. |
| `.sdlc/` | Appears once you run the plugin in a folder: telemetry, manifests, per-run artifacts. Git-ignored, never source. |

## The three packages

| Package | Root | Stack | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ai-sdlc-orchestrator-claude-code-harness` | `.` | Node ESM, Node 20+, one runtime dependency (`yaml`) | The repo harness — setup, cost reporting, and the test suite that guards everything else. |
| `@mmo/model-dispatch` | `plugin/mcp/model-dispatch` | TypeScript, compiled by `tsc` into `dist/`, Node 20+ | The bundled MCP server. Loads the routing policy, picks a model per unit of work, calls the vendor SDK, records tokens and cost. |
| `@mmo/policy-console` | `plugin/policy-console` | Node ESM, Node 20+, no framework, one dependency (`yaml`) | A local web page for picking or authoring a routing policy. One HTML file plus a small http server. |

No workspace manifest ties the three together — there is no pnpm workspace, no Nx, no Turborepo,
no Lerna. Each package carries its own `package.json`, its own `node_modules/` and its own test
command, and you install and test each one where it lives. Installing at the root does not reach
into the other two.

### The optional Python worker

`plugin/mcp/model-dispatch/worker/gemini_worker.py` is a fourth, optional piece: the agent behind
the `antigravity-worker` adapter. It needs Python 3.10 or newer and the `google-antigravity`
package, pinned to `==0.1.16`, both recorded in `worker/requirements.txt`. The pin is exact because the SDK has changed what its usage totals mean between releases (0.1.9 counts cached input inside `prompt_token_count`, 0.1.16 counts it on top), and the plugin bills each sidecar by the reading its recorded version is known to use — see `AGY_USAGE_SEMANTICS` in `src/delegation/workerProcess.ts`. Raise the pin only after checking a new version's token counts against Google's own counter and adding it there. Its virtualenv is
built on demand by `plugin/scripts/verify-setup.mjs --enable-agent` and is git-ignored.

You need it only for the agent path, where the cheap tier — the mechanical phases the policy routes
away from Claude — runs as a full agent session with tools and a working directory. On the model
path, one API call per unit of work, nothing here is installed and nothing here runs.

## Entry points

| File | Reach for it when |
|---|---|
| `tools/setup.mjs` | Installing from a clone rather than the marketplace. Checks prerequisites, checks the MCP server (it ships pre-built; builds it only when the bundle is missing), writes `.mcp.json`. Also `npm run setup`. |
| `tools/report.mjs` | Rendering the cost report for a finished run: `node tools/report.mjs <pass-dir>`, or `npm run report -- <pass-dir>`. Add `--markdown` for a file-ready version. |
| `plugin/mcp/model-dispatch/src/server.ts` | Reading or changing the MCP server. Claude Code launches the pre-built `bundle/server.mjs`, and the plugin's scripts load `bundle/lib.mjs` (entry `src/lib.ts`); the source is here. `npm run build` in that folder compiles (`tsc`) and then writes both bundles (`scripts/bundle.mjs`); commit `bundle/` with any change under `src/`, or `tools/test/server-bundle.test.mjs` fails. One adapter per model surface sits in `src/adapters/`. |
| `plugin/policy-console/policy-server.mjs` | Serving the policy console on `127.0.0.1`. Normally started for you by `plugin/scripts/setup-policy.mjs`. |
| `plugin/mcp/model-dispatch/worker/gemini_worker.py` | Debugging the agent path. The MCP server spawns it; you do not start it by hand. |
| `plugin/mcp/model-dispatch/src/handoff/` | Reading or changing zero-touch's hand-off tools (`write_document`, `write_tests_from_cases`, `repeat_edit_across_files`, `undo_hand_off`): each tool's form check, brief and answer checks, the scratch copy a test or check command runs in, the record of what landed and its undo. They type through the executor's own typists. |
| `plugin/scripts/ambient/hook.mjs` | Reading or changing what zero-touch does at each hook moment. One dispatcher for zero-touch's sixteen hooks; the rules it applies are in `plugin/scripts/ambient/lib/`. `zero-touch/scripts/start-chat.mjs` is the separate start hook that decides a chat's mode. |
| `plugin/mcp/model-dispatch/src/executor/` | Reading or changing the typed-spec executor (greenfield: `/mmo:greenfield` and `/mmo:pass`). `brief.ts` renders briefs and fix briefs; `typists.ts` holds the three typists (their environments, request shapes and failure classification); `checks.ts` the checks on every answer; `run.ts` the stage runner (the ladder, repairs, warm-up); `acceptance.ts` the acceptance stage (runs the spec's acceptance commands and marks every criterion); `tools.ts` the MCP tools. The typed spec itself is in `src/spec/`, and `worker/typist_worker.py` is the agent-door typist. |
| `plugin/scripts/write-manifest.mjs` | Rebuilding a run's `manifest.json` from its records. Phase 9 runs it; the manifest is never typed by hand. The collector copies the acceptance table into SUMMARY.md with `plugin/scripts/lib/acceptance-summary.mjs`. |
| `plugin/scripts/executor-guard.mjs` | Debugging a refused helper launch or write in an executor run. It keeps that run's orchestrator to the pipeline's own helpers and to writes inside its own run's record folder. |
| `plugin/mcp/model-dispatch/src/runCard.ts` | Reading the run card pre-flight records: the plugin version and commit, Claude Code's version, and the prompt-cache overrides it found. |

## Inside `plugin/`

| Path | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `commands/` | 13 slash commands, one Markdown file each, all namespaced `/mmo:` — `greenfield.md`, `brownfield.md`, `pass.md`, seven per-job aliases, plus `setup.md`, `policy.md` and `revert.md`. |
| `agents/` | 5 subagent definitions: `orchestrator`, `architect`, `discovery`, `senior-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`. |
| `skills/` | Playbooks a subagent reads at run time. `pipeline/SKILL.md` carries the state machine, the task-packet schema (one packet per unit of work, the unit that gets routed to a model) and the approval gates; `brownfield-guide/SKILL.md` covers work on an existing repo. Per-stack guidance lives in `skills/pipeline/stacks/`. |
| `config/policies/` | Routing policies as YAML — the directory listing is the authoritative preset set (`opus-plus-flash.yaml` is the default). A policy maps each phase to a model and prices each model; it sets no cost cap. |
| `config/intents.json` | The seven brownfield job types. |
| `config/ambient.default.json` | mmo's shipped zero-touch settings: `routing`, `routing_defaults` (the cost recording, `auth`), `retention_days`. The person's zero-touch choices (mode, models, hand-off typists) are not here: they are made in the settings box and kept by the `zero-touch` plugin. |
| `mcp/model-dispatch/` | The MCP server package (see the table above). |
| `policy-console/` | The policy console package. |
| `scripts/` | Node scripts the commands shell out to — setup checks, credential discovery, the write-contract hook, provenance recording, run logging. `scripts/ambient/` holds zero-touch: the hook dispatcher and its libraries (workflow mode's recognition, workflow start, second-job queue and project lock; hand-off mode's recognition, lines, model pin and safety net; the chat's mode record), and zero-touch's two step scripts, `workflow-stopped.mjs` and `git-baseline.mjs`, which Claude runs when zero-touch tells it to ([ambient-mode.md](ambient-mode.md)). Nothing of mmo's own uses this folder. `scripts/handoff-models.mjs` asks the server's own router which model a policy gives each kind of hand-off work. |
| `hooks/` | `hooks.json` registers: a `PreToolUse` write-contract check that refuses edits outside an approved file list, a `PreToolUse` rule that keeps the pipeline's own helpers in the foreground, the executor guard (`PreToolUse` and `PostToolUse`) that keeps a greenfield executor run's orchestrator to its own record folder, and a `PostToolUse` telemetry heartbeat: the pipeline's own hooks, with no timeout of their own (the three that run node go through `node.sh`). `ambient.sh` is the POSIX shim for zero-touch's sixteen hooks (eleven for workflow mode, among them the policy stamp on a zero-touch run's model-server calls, the release of a project at `/clear`, and the clean-up after a turn that ended in an error, and five more for hand-off mode), which the zero-touch plugin registers in its own `zero-touch/hooks/hooks.json` and runs through `zero-touch/hooks/mmo-hook.sh`; they do nothing in a chat the zero-touch plugin did not mark. |
| `templates/` | Fragments copied into a target project, such as the `.gitignore` entry for run artifacts. |
| `examples/` | Sandbox projects you point the plugin at by hand — six tiny apps, one per brownfield job type — plus copies of the four example briefs, which live here because only `plugin/` is copied on install. |

## Running the tests

From the repo root:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

`npm test` expands to `node --test --import ./tools/test/lib/stand-in-claude.mjs tools/test/*.test.mjs && node tools/test-mcp.mjs`.
The 17 files under `tools/test/` cover setup, command wiring, the write-contract hook, logging, reporting and
the writing style. The suite is offline — no API key, no network call, no cost.

Two things the root tests need from the computer:
- **Claude Code's `claude` program.** Zero-touch checks for it before a new-app workflow or a Claude hand-off. On a
  computer without it (GitHub's test runner), `tools/test/lib/stand-in-claude.mjs` puts a stand-in first on PATH: it
  answers `--version` and `--help` and refuses anything else, so no test runs a model. A real `claude` is never replaced.
- **The server's compiled code** (`plugin/mcp/model-dispatch/dist/`, not committed), which some root tests import.
  Build it once with `npx tsc` in `plugin/mcp/model-dispatch` (or `npm run build` there, which also rebuilds the
  committed bundle). The GitHub workflow runs `npx tsc` before the tests.

`tools/test-mcp.mjs` chains the MCP server's own suite onto the end. That suite compiles TypeScript
first, so it needs the server's dependencies installed:

```bash
cd plugin/mcp/model-dispatch
npm install
npm test        # npm run build && node --test test/*.test.mjs
```

When `plugin/mcp/model-dispatch/node_modules/` is absent, `tools/test-mcp.mjs` prints a notice
naming the package it skipped and exits 0. Green output alone does not mean the server was tested
— read the tail of the run, or run `npm run verify -- --fix` once, which installs the server's
dependencies, builds it, and rebuilds the Python worker's virtualenv if the agent path is enabled.

## The style gate

`CLAUDE.md` sets the writing rules for docs and source comments: second person, present tense,
tables for reference material, and a list of banned marketing words. `tools/test/style.test.mjs`
enforces them, so a documentation change can fail `npm test` on wording alone.

Excluded from the check: `SETUP.md` and everything under `plugin/commands/`, `plugin/agents/` and
`plugin/skills/`, which are instruction files addressed to Claude, where third-person phrasing is
correct. Historical records under `docs/walkthroughs/` and `examples/*/passes/` are excluded too.

Run `npm test` before you open a pull request. It is offline and free.
