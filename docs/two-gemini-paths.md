# The two Gemini paths — measured comparison

> **For:** choosing between Gemini as a model vs Gemini as an agent; the actual token / cost / wall-clock numbers on the same brief. **Also see:** [setup.md](setup.md) · [methodology.md](methodology.md) · [architecture.md](architecture.md).

The `opus-plus-flash` policy can reach the mechanical tier as a model or as an agent. Same vendor, same model, same rates. This page records the numbers a single small brief produced down each door on the same machine, so the trade is a number rather than a claim.

## The two doors

| | Model path (`flash-completion`) | Agent path (`flash-agsdk-worker`) |
|---|---|---|
| Auth | Vertex ADC **or** AI Studio API key | Vertex ADC only |
| Client | `@google/genai` completion call | `google-antigravity` SDK, Python subprocess |
| Per-packet shape | one request, one response | tool loop; SDK re-sends full conversation each turn |
| Fixed per-turn overhead | none | ~11.5k prompt tokens (SDK identity preamble) |
| Extra runtime | none | Python 3.10+ |
| Evidence on disk | one telemetry event | telemetry event + task brief + worker sidecar + receipt |

Configuration and the choice mechanism are in [setup.md](setup.md#gemini-as-an-agent--antigravity-sdk).

## One brief, both doors — recorded 2026-08-05

Ping Service brief ([examples/quick-demo/](../examples/quick-demo/)), same policy, same machine, four human approval gates.

| | Model path | Agent path |
|---|---|---|
| Input tokens | 43,027 | 1,714,495 |
| — of which cache reads | — | 1,038,870 |
| Output tokens | 33,647 | 72,727 |
| Recorded cost | $0.84 | $2.18 |
| Packets dispatched | 5 | 5 |
| Delegation evidence files | — | 15 |
| Tests | 2/2 green | 3/3 green |
| Elapsed | 28 min | 63 min |

**23× the tokens for 2.6× the cost.** Context caching moves that ratio: over a million of the agent path's input tokens are cache reads at 10% of the fresh rate. Without it the volume would have been prohibitive.

**Elapsed time is not a system measurement.** Both runs stop at four human approval gates, so the clock includes reviewer time. Tokens and cost are machine-recorded.

**Costs are in estimator mode.** Treat them as the shape of the trade, not an invoice. Vendor-mode figures would reconcile to the Anthropic and Google dashboards.

## What each path produces that the other does not

**Agent path — per-packet audit trail.** Each delegated packet writes three files to disk: the task brief the worker was handed, a delegation record of what it did, and the vendor usage receipt for it. Five packets → fifteen files. Answers *"what was this worker asked to do, what did it touch, and what did it cost"* from disk without re-running anything.

**Model path — no per-packet trail.** The same question has no answer beyond the run-level aggregate in `telemetry.jsonl`.

## Reproducing

Two prompts, in an empty folder with Claude Code open. This spends real money and needs credentials — see [setup.md](setup.md).

```
Setup this plugin from this repo - https://github.com/tl-ai-labs/ai-sdlc-orchestrator-claude-code-harness
```

Then, in a new session:

```
/sdlc:run
```

Pick Ping Service. It exercises every phase in minutes and costs roughly $0.84 on the model path. To reproduce the agent-path row, enable the agent before running:

```bash
node "$(ls -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/tilicho-ai-labs/sdlc/*/scripts/verify-setup.mjs | tail -1)" --enable-agent
```

Verify it took effect with `probe-agent-worker.mjs` (~2¢).
