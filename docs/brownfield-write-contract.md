# Brownfield write contract

The plugin's promise for brownfield mode is: **nothing outside a confirmed file-scope gets
touched.** This document explains how that promise is enforced and answers common "will this
touch X?" questions.

## The contract

**The orchestrator MAY NOT write to any path unless:**

- The path is in the run's `allowlist` (confirmed by you at Gate 0), OR
- The path did not exist at discovery time (a new file), OR
- You re-opened Gate 0 to explicitly expand scope.

**Off-limits paths are hard-rejected** at the tool boundary — before any file-system change
happens.

## Three enforcement layers

The contract is enforced at three layers. Each has different strength and different failure
modes.

| # | Layer | Strength | What it protects against |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Orchestrator prompt gate | **Soft** — instruction to the AI | AI diligence (drops if the model drifts) |
| 2 | Packet validator | **Schema-level** — `TaskPacket.artifact_path` check | Planned writes with bad paths |
| 3 | PreToolUse hook | **HARD** — refused at the tool boundary | Everything, including ad-hoc writes |

Only layer 3 is unbreakable. If the AI ever tries to write outside the allowlist — via a
planned packet OR a spur-of-the-moment `Write` — the hook refuses it at the tool boundary.
Claude Code declines the tool call. The file system is never touched.

## The hook

Implemented in [`plugin/scripts/write-contract-check.mjs`](../plugin/scripts/write-contract-check.mjs).
Registered as a `PreToolUse` matcher on `Write|Edit` in
[`plugin/hooks/hooks.json`](../plugin/hooks/hooks.json).

Behavior:

1. On every `Write` or `Edit` tool call, Claude Code invokes the hook.
2. The hook reads `.sdlc/local/write-contract.json` from an ancestor of the current directory.
3. If the file is missing or `active:false` → allow (greenfield mode or no active run — the
   hook silently no-ops so `/sdlc:run` in an empty folder is unaffected).
4. If active:
   - Check the target path against `off_limits` patterns — deny with reason if hit.
   - Check against `allowlist` patterns — allow if hit.
   - Otherwise (not in allowlist, not off-limits) — deny.
5. `contract.strict = false` (equivalent to `--strict-write=off`) downgrades every enforcement
   to a warning; the file is written but a warning is logged.

Fail-safe: any bug in the hook (parse failures, missing fields, resolvable path issues) → allow.
Better to permit a write than to wedge user work on a plugin bug. Denials only happen when the
contract parses cleanly AND is active AND the path fails the check.

## Off-limits, two tiers

Off-limits paths come from two sources merged into the run's write contract:

| Tier | Source | Written when | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Project defaults** | `.sdlc/project.json.off_limits_default` | Once at setup by `/sdlc:setup` — a fixed list every run in this folder inherits. | `.env*`, `.mcp.json`, `.cursor/`, `.aider*`, `.continue/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.roo/`, `node_modules/**`, `dist/**`, LFS-marked files, submodules. |
| **Per-run additions** | Gate 0's off-limits list | Each brownfield run, on top of the defaults. | Anything ticket-specific — a directory you know shouldn't move for this particular change. |

The merge happens at Gate 0. The write contract at `.sdlc/local/write-contract.json` holds the merged result. The PreToolUse hook reads it and never sees the two tiers as distinct — a hit in either denies the write.

Change the project defaults by editing `.sdlc/project.json.off_limits_default` in a PR (committed, team-shared). Change per-run additions by editing Gate 0's proposal before approving.

## Merge semantics for sensitive files (deep-merge, never overwrite)

Even when a file is in the allowlist, the plugin uses deep-merge semantics for anything
sensitive:

| File | Rule |
|---|---|
| `package.json` | Add missing deps/scripts; never remove; never downgrade; new script names must not shadow existing |
| `.env` / `.env.example` | Append missing KEY names only; never rewrite values; **never `cp .env.test .env` when `.env` exists** |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Never touch (only append one `@import` line at first setup, via mini-gate with diff preview) |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Read → parse → deep-merge → write, with diff at mini-gate |
| `.mcp.json` | Same as `.claude/settings.json` |
| `routing-policy.yaml` | **Never touched if pre-existing** (surfaced at Gate 0 so its presence is visible) |
| `.cursor/rules`, `.aider*`, `.continue/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Default off-limits (from `project.json.off_limits_default`); only editable if explicitly moved into allowlist at Gate 0 |

## Diff-preview mini-gate for pre-existing files

Any packet targeting a file that existed at discovery time triggers a diff-preview:

1. Packet dispatches → returns proposed content.
2. Orchestrator computes a unified diff between the current file and the proposed content.
3. Diff is shown to you inline.
4. Approve → write. Revise → dispatch again with your comments. Abort → skip this packet.

This is the concrete answer to the "the plugin doesn't know how you use Gemini / Cursor / your own tooling" problem — even if discovery misclassified a file's role, the diff appears before the write lands.

## FAQ

| Question | Answer | Escape hatch |
|---|---|---|
| Will this touch my `.env`? | No, ever. `.env*` is in `.sdlc/project.json.off_limits_default` — the write contract refuses writes there regardless of intent. If codegen introduces a new required env var, the KEY name (not the value) is appended to `.env.example` and a mini-gate asks you to populate `.env` before Phase 7 tests run. | None. `.env` values are yours. |
| Will this touch my Cursor rules (`.cursor/`)? | No. Default off-limits. | Move `.cursor/` into the allowlist at Gate 0 by editing the proposal. |
| Will this touch my `package.json`? | Only to add missing dependencies (deep-merge, append-only) and only when a codegen packet explicitly requires it. Never removes, downgrades, or shadows existing scripts. | None needed — the merge rules already enforce safety. |
| What if I have `commit_strategy: per-gate`? | The plugin refuses to run on a dirty tree so your uncommitted work does not tangle with the plugin's commits. Defaults are safe: `branch_strategy: current`, `commit_strategy: none`, `pr: off`. | `--allow-dirty` bypasses the git-clean check. |
| Can the AI bypass the hook? | No. The hook is a Claude Code `PreToolUse` matcher — refusals happen before the tool executes. No prompt-level workaround reaches the file system. | `contract.strict = false` in `write-contract.json`, or `--strict-write=off` at run start. Both require explicit user action. |
| How do I override off-limits for one specific run? | Re-open Gate 0 with `revise:` and move the specific path from `off_limits` to `allowlist`. Ephemeral — applies to this run only. | None. `.sdlc/project.json.off_limits_default` is unchanged by this. |
| My repo has files with unusual characters — will pattern matching work? | Yes. The hook uses glob-style pattern matching (`*`, `**`, `?`, literal `/`). No shell-out, no eval on paths. Unicode, spaces, and exotic characters all work. | None needed. |
| What if I run `git checkout` or `git reset --hard` mid-run? | The plugin observes git state between phases via `git status`. If HEAD moved unexpectedly, it halts with a clear message before continuing. | None. The halt is the safety guarantee — better to stop than write against a repo that changed under it. |
