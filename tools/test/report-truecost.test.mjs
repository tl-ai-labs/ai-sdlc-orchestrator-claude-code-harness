/**
 * Guards the report's true-cost rendering — the reader-facing half of the
 * orchestrator-overhead fix. Quiet failures this pins against:
 *   - the collector's `tier: "orchestrator"` event lands in "Runner overhead"
 *     and silently blends the two spends (the exact bug class the collector
 *     exists to prevent);
 *   - a dispatched-only total renders without its scope caveat, and a reader
 *     compares architectures from a number that undercounts one door ~100×;
 *   - the report recomputes the true total instead of preferring the
 *     manifest's, and the two files disagree;
 *   - the Markdown branch drops any of the above.
 *
 * The report runs as a real subprocess against a fixture pass directory,
 * because what is being tested is what a person sees. $0, offline.
