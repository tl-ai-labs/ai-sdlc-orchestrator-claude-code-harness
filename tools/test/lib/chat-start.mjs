/**
 * A real chat always begins with Claude Code's start moment (SessionStart, source "startup"), and zero-touch acts
 * only in a chat whose start the zero-touch plugin marked (29 Sep 2026; zero-touch/scripts/start-chat.mjs writes the
 * chat's record, plugin/scripts/ambient/lib/chat-mode.mjs reads it). So a test chat starts the way a real chat with
 * the zero-touch plugin enabled does: the zero-touch plugin's start hook, then mmo's, once per chat and with the same
 * settings. A test that sends a chat's later moments straight to the hook gets that start first; a test that sends
 * the start moment itself (any source) gets the zero-touch hook run beside it, as Claude Code runs both plugins' start
 * hooks at the same moment. A test about a chat WITHOUT the plugin passes `zeroTouch: false`, or runs its own start.
 *
 * runOnce(event, payload, ...rest) sends one hook moment; keyOf(...rest) names the test's own home folder (MMO_HOME),
 * so two tests that reuse a chat id in different homes are two chats; envOf(...rest) gives that call's extra
 * environment, so a test's MMO_AMBIENT reaches the zero-touch hook too.
 *
 * Settings (1 Oct 2026): a person sets zero-touch up in the settings box, and the plugin keeps the choices in its own
 * data folder (zero-touch/scripts/settings.mjs). A test person is one who has already chosen: each test home gets
 * `<home>/zt-data/settings.json`, Workflows on the standard models, unless the test wrote its own settings first
 * (writeZtSettings) or asks for the first chat after install (`firstRun: true`, no settings at all). A person who has
 * chosen models with Google's Flash 3.8 has connected Google, so the test home also gets a complete gcloud login file
 * (the file `gcloud auth application-default login` writes; nothing is ever sent anywhere); `google: false` leaves it out.
