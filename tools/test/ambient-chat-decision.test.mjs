/**
 * Each chat is decided once, when it starts (29 Sep 2026). Read at different moments, an on/off setting changed
 * mid-chat would leave a chat half on and half off. So the decision is the chat's record, written once at its start by
 * the zero-touch plugin (enabled in Claude Code's plugin list: every new chat gets it; disabled: none does), and it
 * holds for the whole chat; a change reaches new chats only. A chat with no record is off. No settings file takes
 * part. What "on" shows here: a message the rules recognise as a job gets the instruction to start its workflow.
 *
 * Every hook case runs through the real shell shim with its own MMO_HOME and project folder. No network, no model.
