/**
 * Zero-touch routing, hand-off half (ask 2, step 4), end to end through the real shell shim: a chat message the
 * rules recognise starts that job's /mmo: workflow; everything else, an unclear request included, stays an ordinary
 * chat with nothing added (26 Sep: no offers; 0.8.4: no generic orchestrator). Every case pipes the hook input Claude Code sends and reads
 * the decision back. Facts the design rests on were probed live on Claude Code 2.1.282: a command start, typed or
 * model-started, is a PreToolUse on the Skill tool ({skill, args}); only a typed one fires UserPromptExpansion; a
 * PreToolUse deny stops it and the model reads the reason.
 *
 * Each test has its own MMO_HOME and project folder. No network, no model call.
