/**
 * Zero-touch hand-off mode, the hook around a hand-off tool call.
 *
 * The hand-off tools live in the mmo plugin's server, which never sees a chat. Two hook moments connect the two:
 *
 *   before the call (PreToolUse)  in a hand-off chat the hook adds a stamp to the call (`_mmo`): the chat's id, the
 *                                 project folder and who pays for a Claude typist. The server takes nothing else
 *                                 from the call about the chat: the chat's policy and models are read from the
 *                                 chat's own records, which the hook makes sure are resolved before it stamps.
 *                                 Anywhere else the call is refused: a chat in workflow mode, and a chat that is
 *                                 running a workflow (a workflow has its own steps and its own bill).
 *   after the call (PostToolUse)  the person sees one line, written by code from the tool's receipt: what was
 *                                 written, by which model, what it cost; or that the hand-off failed and the chat's
 *                                 model writes the file itself. The model reads the receipt; the line is never
 *                                 given to it.
 *
 * Every case runs through the real shell shim with its own MMO_HOME and project folder. No network, no model.
