/**
 * Regression pins for the estimated-mode driver-model fix.
 *
 * The defect: all five driver agents carried `model: opus` in their
 * frontmatter, so under --auth=estimated the judgment tier always executed
 * Opus (frontmatter overrides the session model) no matter what driver model
 * the policy named — the policy only priced the work. The fix removes the
 * pins and moves the execution decision to CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL,
 * verified at run start by plugin/scripts/driver-model-check.mjs.
 *
 * These pins keep the fix from regressing editorially: a `model:` key
 * reappearing in any driver agent's frontmatter would silently reintroduce
 * the override, and the orchestrator losing its run-start rule would let
 * unset/mismatched env vars go unnoticed again. The script's behavior itself
 * is tested in plugin/mcp/model-dispatch/test/driverModelCheck.test.mjs,
 * which runs after the MCP build (the script imports the compiled routing).
 *
 * Offline, reads repo files only.
