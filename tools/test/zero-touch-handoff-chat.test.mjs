/**
 * Zero-touch hand-off mode, inside the chat: what each message a person types does, and what keeps the chat on its
 * model.
 *
 * In a hand-off chat (mode `b`, zero-touch/scripts/start-chat.mjs):
 *   - plain words never start a workflow. "Fix the login bug" or "build me a todo app" is the chat's own work. A
 *     workflow starts only when the person types its command, and then runs exactly as in any chat;
 *   - a message asking for a new document, spec, plan, tests or the same change across files is recognised by fixed
 *     rules (lib/handoff-route.mjs), and the chat's model is reminded to hand that work off;
 *   - the person sees one line after every message (the hook's `systemMessage`, never given to the model): where the
 *     work goes. The line names the models that really do it: the hand-off policy's model for that kind of work,
 *     asked of the workflows' own router once per chat, and the model the chat is on now;
 *   - the chat stays on its pinned model: a switch to another model is refused (Claude Code's PreModelSwitch hook),
 *     and while the chat is on another model anyway, every line says so and how to switch back.
 *
 * Every case runs through the real shell shim with its own MMO_HOME and project folder. No network, no model.
