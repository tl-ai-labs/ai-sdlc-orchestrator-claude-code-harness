/**
 * The MCP tools of zero-touch's hand-off mode (docs/ambient-mode.md, "Hand-off mode").
 *
 * In a hand-off chat the chat's own model does the development, and work that is mostly typing AND has a check code
 * can run on the result goes to the hand-off policy's model through these tools:
 *
 *  - write_document — one NEW document, spec or planning text, written from a form the chat's model fills in
 *    (document.ts), checked by code, then written into the project.
 *  - write_tests_from_cases — one NEW test file for cases the chat's model decided (tests.ts), run with the
 *    project's own test command in a scratch copy of the project (scratch.ts); written only when its tests pass.
 *  - repeat_edit_across_files — a change the chat's model made once, repeated in the files it names as exact edits
 *    (repeat.ts), each checked, then all of them run against the project's check command in a scratch copy.
 *  - undo_hand_off — takes a landed hand-off back (landing.ts).
 *
 * Each call carries the stamp the plugin's hook adds (`_mmo`); the chat it names must be a hand-off chat, and its
 * policy and the model that policy gives each kind of work are read from the chat's own records (chat.ts), so they
 * are the ones the chat started with. The model never chooses the policy, the model or the auth mode in a call.
 *
 * A reply is one short receipt. A refused form and a failed hand-off are ordinary replies with `status` and `next`
 * (what the chat's model does now), not errors: both are outcomes the chat's model acts on.
