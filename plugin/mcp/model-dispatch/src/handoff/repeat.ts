/**
 * repeat_edit_across_files: the form, the brief and the checks (zero-touch hand-off mode).
 *
 * The chat's model makes a change ONCE, by hand, in one file (the example). Repeating it in other files is typing:
 * the hand-off policy's model gets the example's own change (its diff since the last commit), the change in words,
 * and one target file at a time, and answers with exact edits for that file. Code checks each answer before any
 * file is touched:
 *
 *  - every edit's search text is in the file exactly once (the executor's own rule, applyEdits), so an edit lands
 *    where it was meant or not at all;
 *  - an edit removes only lines the change is about. The words the example's change took away (in its removed lines
 *    and not in its added ones: `getUser` for a rename to `fetchUser`, `moment` for a move to another library) mark
 *    such a line; an edit that removes a line carrying none of them is rewriting something else, and is refused. A
 *    change that only added lines took no word away, so its repeats may add lines and remove none.
 *
 * Then all the changed files are written into a scratch copy of the project (scratch.ts) and the project's check
 * command runs there. Only when it passes are the files written into the project, as one landing that one call
 * undoes. A target whose edits never pass is named back to the chat's model, which changes that file itself.
