/**
 * The acceptance stage: code, not a model, decides whether the finished project meets the brief.
 *
 * It runs every command of the plan's acceptance list, in order, in its folder under the code
 * directory, keeps each command's whole output on disk, and judges it by the pass rule the plan
 * states (an exit code, and output lines the brief forbids). Every acceptance criterion is then
 * pass, fail, or not checked with the reason the plan gives. The table it writes is the one the
 * final report carries (the collector copies it into SUMMARY.md).
 *
 * A failure names who can fix it: an install or audit failure is a version choice, so it goes back
 * to the architect, which has the registry; a failing check is code, so it goes to a repair round.
 * The stage runs at most once plus ACCEPTANCE_RECHECKS times per plan; a further call runs nothing.
 * The count belongs to the spec it ran for: a different spec in the same folder starts at run 1, and
 * the earlier spec's results are moved under previous/, not deleted.
