/**
 * The briefs a typist receives, rendered from the typed spec by code.
 *
 * Two parts, in this order:
 *  1. The SHARED block — stack, commands, decisions, conventions, data model,
 *     API, and an index of every file of the project with its exports.
 *     Byte-identical for every unit of a run, and placed FIRST so each vendor
 *     can reuse it from cache: Claude Code caches it as part of the system
 *     prompt (it is passed with --append-system-prompt-file), the completion
 *     door places it first as its project header, and the Antigravity typist
 *     appends it to its system prompt. Measured on eight TeamBoard units:
 *     putting the shared part first made the lean Opus typist 33% cheaper
 *     (task folder, probes/s2-typist-bakeoff, round 2).
 *  2. The UNIT block — the entries of the units this file uses, the unit
 *     itself, and the answer contract.
 *
 * The file index is there so a brief is complete on its own: a typist sees the
 * spec entries of the files it depends on, and the index tells it where every
 * other module lives and what it exports, so it never invents one. In step 2 a
 * lean Opus file imported `app.logging`, which no unit writes; the index, and
 * the import check in checks.ts, remove that class of error for every typist.
 *
 * Two answer contracts. Writing a file: {"path", "content"}. Fixing a file
 * (the repair stage): exact edits {"path", "edits": [{"search", "replace"}]},
 * each search found exactly once in the current text, or the whole file as
 * {"path", "content"} when most of it changes.
 *
 * Every typist gets the same words: the unit block is framed by the
 * completion door's own buildUserPrompt, the single definition of that frame.
