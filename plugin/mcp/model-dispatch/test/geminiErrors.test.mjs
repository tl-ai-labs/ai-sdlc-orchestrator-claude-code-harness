/**
 * A failed completion-door call is described by the vendor's own fields, and a
 * call Google answered with an error costs nothing.
 *
 * Google's error carries its HTTP status (`ApiError.status`) and, when it asks
 * for a pause, a `google.rpc.RetryInfo` entry in the JSON error body; a
 * connection that failed in transit carries a Node/undici code. The adapter
 * records all three on the attempt, so callers decide from fields rather than
 * from the error's wording.
 *
 * A call Google answered with an error status is billed $0. Google's own words:
 * Vertex AI "You're charged only for requests that return a 200 response code.
 * Requests returning any other response codes, such as 4xx and 5xx codes,
 * aren't charged for the input or output." (cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/
 * generative-ai/pricing); the Gemini API "If your request fails with a 400 or
 * 500 error, you won't be charged for the tokens used." (ai.google.dev/
 * gemini-api/docs/billing), both read 2026-09-24. Measured too: in the step-2
 * bake-off Google's own token counter matched, to the token, receipts that
 * counted nothing for four refused (429) calls. A connection that failed with
 * no response keeps the stated bound: the prompt billed as input, since the
 * request may have been answered.
