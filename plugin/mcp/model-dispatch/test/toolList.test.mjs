/**
 * The tools this server lists, read the way Claude Code reads them: the built server started over stdio, an MCP
 * `initialize`, then `tools/list`.
 *
 * Why (0.8.4): the generic orchestrator that made other chats cheaper is removed, and with it the ten worker tools
 * this server used to list in every chat, workflow runs included (fix_from_analysis, write_files_from_specs, lookup,
 * ...). The list is the pipeline's own tools, the executor's, and the tools of zero-touch's hand-off mode.
 *
 * The hand-off tools are listed in every chat, because the server cannot know a chat's mode when its tools are
 * listed (a chat can change mode at /clear while the server keeps running, and a hand-off chat whose tools were
 * missing could neither hand a document off nor type it). A call is refused unless the plugin's hook stamped it in a
 * hand-off chat, which the second test proves through the real server.
