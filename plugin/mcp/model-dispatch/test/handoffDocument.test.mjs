/**
 * Zero-touch hand-off mode, the write_document tool: a new document, spec or planning text is written by the
 * hand-off policy's model from a brief the chat's model fills in, and reaches the project only after code has
 * checked it.
 *
 * What is proved here, with fake typists (no model calls, no network):
 *  - the form is enforced before anything is sent: every field filled, every string one line (a form that already
 *    holds the finished text is refused), the file new and inside the project, every fact that names a project file
 *    quoted from that file word for word;
 *  - the brief carries the sections and the facts, and tells the typist it may state nothing else;
 *  - the answer is checked by code: every section is there, every shell command is one of the facts, every project
 *    path it names exists; a refused answer goes back with the reason, and only a checked document is written;
 *  - the ladder: two attempts by the policy's model, then the policy's Claude model, and the receipt says so; when
 *    every attempt fails nothing is written and the chat's model is told to write the file itself;
 *  - a transport failure waits and is not an attempt; a refused login skips the model's second attempt;
 *  - the tool works only in a chat the zero-touch plugin marked for hand-off, with the models that chat resolved.
