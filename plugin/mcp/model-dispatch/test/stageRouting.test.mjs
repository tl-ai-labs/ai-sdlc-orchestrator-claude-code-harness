/**
 * Who types a file depends on the pipeline stage and the policy — never on the
 * file's language, name or type label (24 Sep, the receivables campaign).
 *
 * Why: the two-model policies sent a code file to the cheaper model only when
 * its task type was on a list written for NestJS/React projects
 * (controller_handler, dto, react_component, ...); any other label, and the
 * catch-all "other", fell to the default rule — Opus. On a Go, Rust or Python
 * greenfield project most files carry no such label, so the multi-model arm
 * quietly became solo Opus. A greenfield project can be in any language, so
 * routing must not know about file types at all: the same stage routes the
 * same way whatever the task type says.
