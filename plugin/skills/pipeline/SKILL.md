## Phase -1 — preflight_dispatch (MANDATORY, before anything else)

Call `preflight_dispatch` with the run's `auth_mode` and the same `policy_name` / `project_root` /
`policy_path` you will use for the run, and **read the result before doing anything else**.

`auth_mode` is required and is the mode already resolved for this run (rule 6) — do not omit it, do not
guess it. It changes the answer: it is what tells pre-flight which models this run actually dispatches
through the server.

**If `ok` is false, STOP.** Print the `halt_reason` verbatim, print the failing model's `error`, and end
the run. Do not read the brief, do not start phase 1, do not "try the mechanical tier and see". A policy
whose cheap tier cannot be reached does not degrade into a slightly-more-expensive run — every packet
falls back to the premium tier, and the result costs *more* than a single-model baseline while appearing
to succeed. That is the one outcome this plugin exists to disprove, so it is worth refusing to start.

**If `warnings` is non-empty, print each one and keep going.** A warning is a model this run will not
dispatch to, so its failure cannot affect this run — under `estimated` that is the direct tier, which
runs inside your own session and never touches the server or its credentials. Print them because they
are true and the operator should know the same policy would not start in `vendor` mode. Do not treat a
warning as a halt: refusing to start a viable run is not the safe error, it is the one that teaches the
operator to override a gate that exists to protect them.

**`not_selected` is not a warning and not a problem.** A policy may hold more than one way of reaching a
tier — `opus-plus-flash` reaches its mechanical tier either as a Gemini model call or as an Antigravity
agent — and only the one this install selected can be dispatched to. The other is listed here, unchecked,
because its prerequisites are irrelevant to a run that will never call it. Do not report it as a failure,
do not try to "fix" it, and do not offer to install anything on its behalf.

**If `ok` is true**, report the configuration to the user in one line before phase 1 — the policy name,
each model, and on the Google Cloud path the resolved project and region — then continue. This is the only point in
the run where the operator can see what is about to be billed and to which project, while it is still
free to stop.

This call constructs each adapter, which is where credential discovery happens and where a missing or
unusable credential throws. It makes no model call and costs nothing. It exists because that
construction used to happen lazily at the first mechanical packet — phase 4 of 9, after the premium
phases were already billed — which is the worst possible moment to discover a setup problem.

**Escalation to the direct tier under `estimated` stays in-session.** `opus-plus-flash` escalates a
`debug` packet to the premium model after two mechanical-tier retries (`retry_count: { gte: 2 }`). In
`estimated` mode that escalated packet is yours to handle in your own conversation, with char-count
estimation and `provenance: "estimated"`, exactly like every other direct-tier phase — do not dispatch
it via `execute_with_model`, and do not conclude from a pre-flight warning about that model that the
escalation path is broken. The routing decision is unchanged; only the transport differs.

## Phase-by-phase prompts

### Phase 1 — requirements_analysis

Read `<brief.md>` (passed in $ARGUMENTS) and produce `<output_dir>/requirements.md` with sections:

- **In scope** (numbered, testable)
- **Out of scope** (numbered)
- **Functional requirements per module** (FR-1, FR-2, ...)
- **Non-functional requirements** (NFR-1, ...)
- **PII inventory** (table: field, sensitivity, protection)
- **Role matrix** (role × resource × action)
- **Acceptance criteria** (numbered, executable)
- **Open questions for HITL** (if any)

### Phase 2 — architecture_design (delegated to `architect` subagent)

The orchestrator invokes the `architect` subagent passing `<output_dir>/requirements.md`. Architect writes `<output_dir>/design.md` (see architect.md for content spec).

### Phase 4 — plan_task_packets

From `design.md`, emit `<output_dir>/packets.json` — a list of TaskPackets, one per file-sized unit of work.

Suggested packet types and one packet per:

| task_type | What |
|---|---|
| `prisma_schema` | full `schema.prisma` |
| `entity` | one Prisma model annotation set (if any custom) |
| `dto` | one DTO file (create/update/query DTOs grouped per resource) |
| `controller_handler` | one controller class (all routes for one resource) |
| `service_method` | one service class |
| `module_wiring` | one NestJS @Module file |
| `guard` | one guard class |
| `interceptor` | one interceptor (e.g. masking, logging) |
| `filter` | global exception filter |
| `migration` | initial migration (or `db push` script) |
| `seed_data` | seed.ts producing demo employees + roles |
| `test_unit` | unit tests per service |
| `test_integration` | integration tests per controller (Supertest) |
| `docstring` | TSDoc on public service methods |
| `readme_section` | one section of the project README |
| `adr_draft` | one ADR file |
| `env_docs` | `.env.example` — every required environment variable from `design.md` §6, no values |
| `env_test_fixture` | `.env.test` — every required environment variable with a value that satisfies the schema declared in `design.md` §6 (e.g., a 32-char string where the schema demands `min(32)`, `file:./test.db` for the DB URL, a hex-encoded fake KEK). This file is what the test runner copies to `.env` before `npm test`. |

When the app uses a validating `ConfigModule` (or Joi / Zod / envalid equivalent), packets for `env_docs` and `env_test_fixture` are **required** — omitting either is a senior-reviewer blocker. The two files must be internally consistent: every key listed in `.env.example` must appear in `.env.test` with a schema-valid value.

### Brownfield-mode task types (v1)

The table above is greenfield-Nest-centric. In brownfield mode (`mode: brownfield`), packets use a **stack-agnostic** base set of primitives plus an optional `subtype` hint that the loaded stack adapter (`plugin/skills/pipeline/stacks/*.md`) resolves to concrete codegen guidance.

| task_type | Purpose | Common `subtype` values |
|---|---|---|
| `new_file_add` | Create a file that didn't exist at discovery time | `nest_controller` · `nest_service` · `django_view` · `fastapi_router` · `test` (see adapter) |
| `existing_file_edit` | Modify a file that already existed | `module_wiring` · `url_registration` · `router_wiring` · `django_settings` |
| `patch_apply` | Apply a specific unified diff | (rare — usually `existing_file_edit` is enough) |
| `doc_addition` | New doc under docs/ or module README | `readme` · `adr` · `runbook` · `api` |
| `doc_update` | Update an existing doc | — |
| `test_add` | New test file for new source | `unit` · `integration` · `e2e` |
| `test_backfill` | Add tests for existing untested code | Same as `test_add` |
| `bug_reproduce` | Failing test that captures the bug | — |
| `bug_diagnose` | Root-cause analysis — emit a note, not code | — |
| `bug_fix_apply` | Apply the fix identified by `bug_diagnose` | — |
| `refactor_extract` | Extract shared logic into a new utility | — |
| `dependency_add` | Add a dep + adjacent-code adjustments | `patch` · `minor` · `major` |

**Framework-owned wiring** — new controllers/routes/views usually need a corresponding
registration edit in a wiring file (Nest module, Django urls.py, FastAPI main.py's
include_router). Emit these as **paired packets** with the same `pass_id` — atomic per-pair:
if the wiring edit fails, roll back the new-file packet within the same pair.

**Every brownfield packet MUST set `artifact_path`** (§7.1) so the write-contract validator can
reject off-limits paths at dispatch time. Missing `artifact_path` is a planner bug.

### TaskPacket initial output-ceiling budgets

Set `budget.maxOutputTokens` per phase type. The adapter automatically doubles this ceiling on any attempt that terminates with the vendor's max-tokens stop reason (Anthropic `stop_reason: "max_tokens"`, Gemini `finishReason: "MAX_TOKENS"`), up to 3 doublings or the model's absolute output limit declared in the policy YAML (`max_output_tokens_absolute`), whichever comes first. Cached input keeps retry cost low.

- **Codegen packets:** `3000` (services, controllers, DTOs, tests). Most files fit first-shot; a few large service files double once or twice.
- **Premium packets (design, senior_code_review, security_review):** `5000`. Design and review artifacts are the ones that historically hit the ceiling.
- **Docs, ADR, README:** `3000`. Same doubling behavior.
- **Debug packets:** inherit from the packet they refine.

Every attempt emits its own TelemetryEvent with `attempt_number`, `ceiling_used`, and (on retries) `retry_reason: "output_cap"` — all sharing the packet's `task_id`. The report collapses them into one row per packet.

### Phase 5 — execute_packets

Emit `phase.start` before the first packet and `phase.end` after the last — see "Run logging" in
orchestrator.md. This is the phase with the most silence between pre-flight and Gate 1 otherwise:
every dispatch inside the loop below already logs itself via the MCP server (`route.decide`,
`dispatch.start`/`.end`), but nothing marks the loop's own boundaries without this call.

For each packet, in dependency order:

**Direct-tier work (subagent handles it, no MCP dispatch):** the orchestrator (Opus) writes the file directly. Estimate tokens via `chars/3.8` heuristic for both inputs and outputs; source pricing constants from the loaded policy's `pricing:` block for this model; log a TelemetryEvent via `log_telemetry`.

**Mechanical-tier work (routed to another model):** call `execute_with_model` with the packet, `policy_name`, and `cache_context`. The server routes per policy. Validate the returned structured output against the schema; if invalid, construct a *refined* packet (new id, `retry_count+1`, with the validation error appended to instruction) and re-dispatch. After 2 mechanical-tier retries fail, the policy escalates to the subagent's own tier automatically (rule with `retry_count: { gte: 2 }`).

Write the returned file content to disk at the packet's stated `artifact_path`.

### Phase 6 — senior_code_review

Invoke `senior-reviewer` subagent for each module. Collect refinement packets. Re-dispatch them via Phase 5 mechanics.

### Phase 7 — test_run

**Greenfield mode.** Bootstrap the env fixture first — this is required for any app whose codegen produced a validating `ConfigModule` (or equivalent) at boot. The codegen phase is contractually required (see Phase 5 acceptance criteria and the senior-reviewer's env-fixture check) to emit `.env.example` (docs) and `.env.test` (fixture values that satisfy the declared schema).

```bash
cd <output_dir>
# Only copy .env.test → .env when neither exists. Never overwrite an existing .env —
# a real .env holds real secrets and belongs to the user.
if [ -f .env.test ] && [ ! -f .env ]; then cp .env.test .env; fi
npm install --silent && npm test
```

**Brownfield mode.** The greenfield env-copy above is refused entirely — the repo already has an `.env` (or an equivalent secrets manager) that the user manages, and copying a codegen-produced fixture would either overwrite real secrets or drop the run into a schema-invalid state. Instead:

```bash
cd <repo-root>   # NOT <output_dir> — the app-under-test is the user's actual repo
# Do NOT touch .env under any circumstances. Do NOT copy .env.test → .env.
```

If codegen introduced new required env vars (via `existing_file_edit` on `.env.example`):
1. Append the new keys to `.env.example` (this IS a permitted write — .env.example is in the allowlist by default and holds no values, only key names).
2. Print the list of new keys to the operator with a mini-gate: *"Codegen introduced N new required env vars: X, Y, Z. Populate them in your .env before Phase 7 continues, or say `skip` to run Phase 7 anyway (tests requiring these keys will fail)."*
3. Wait for the user's response before invoking the test command.

The test command in brownfield is `baseline.test_command` (confirmed at Gate 0), not hardcoded `npm test`. Working directory is the repo root (not `<output_dir>`); in monorepos, use the per-package scope from `baseline.monorepo.packages[].test_command` for whichever package the changed files belong to.

**Both modes:**

On failure:
- If the error is `Config validation error: "X" is required` or equivalent → the codegen phase missed keys. In greenfield build a debug TaskPacket routed to codegen to add the missing keys with schema-valid values. In brownfield, ask the user via the mini-gate above; do NOT patch `.env` from the plugin.
- Any other failure → parse the output, build a `debug` TaskPacket with the failing test name + error + relevant source slice. Route via policy. Retry up to 2 cost-efficient tier attempts; escalate to Opus.

**Test-command probe (optional Phase 0.5 in brownfield).** The pipeline pre-check (§7.4) already ran the discovered test command with `--collect-only` / `--dry-run` at prompt 1 to prove deps are installed. If pre-check step 2 failed for this run, Phase 7 halts with the recorded error rather than attempting the real run.

### Phase 8 — security_review

Invoke `security-reviewer` subagent. Writes `<output_dir>/security_review.md`.

### Phase 9 — generate_final_report

Read all events in `<telemetry_path>`. Build rollup manifest using the `buildManifest` shape (see `plugin/mcp/model-dispatch/src/telemetry.ts`). Write `<output_dir>/manifest.json`. Also write a brief `<output_dir>/SUMMARY.md` with: total cost, breakdown, links to key artifacts.

## TaskPacket schema (canonical)

```ts
{
  id: "tp_<phase>_<seq>",
  phase: "codegen" | "tests" | "docs" | "debug" | "refactor" | ...,
  task_type: "controller_handler" | "service_method" | ...,
  module: "employees" | "leave" | ...,
  instruction: "<imperative, <300 tokens>",
  inputs: [ { path, content, reason } ],  // SLICED — never full files unless necessary
  outputSchema: { /* JSON schema */ },
  acceptance: ["<testable bullet>", ...],
  budget: { maxInputTokens: 4000, maxOutputTokens: 3000 },  // codegen initial; adapter doubles on max_tokens truncation up to 3× (see below)
  retry_count: 0,
  pass_id: "pass1" | "pass2"
}
```

## Intent matrix — brownfield only

**Applies only when `mode: brownfield`.** Greenfield (`/mmo:greenfield`) runs the full pipeline
described above with no matrix-based branching.

In brownfield, one state machine handles seven intents. Which phases fire — and what shape their
outputs take — depends on the intent picked at Gate 0. Tier assignment (which model runs each
phase) does NOT change per intent; that's fixed by the loaded policy (§11).

| Intent | Phase 1 · requirements | Phase 2 · architecture | Phase 4 · packet plan | Phase 7 · tests | Phase 8 · security review |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **docs** | scoped ("what docs?") | **SKIP** | `doc_addition` / `doc_update` packets | doc-lint only | changed files only |
| **bugfix** | reproduce + diagnose | **SKIP** unless design-affecting | `bug_reproduce` → `bug_diagnose` → `bug_fix_apply` → `test_add` | regression + focused suite | changed files only |
| **feature-extend** | delta requirements | delta `change_plan.md` | mixed `existing_file_edit` + `new_file_add` | affected suites | changed files only |
| **feature-new** | new-feature requirements | full subsystem design (`change_plan.md`) | full mix (`new_file_add`, `test_add`, `doc_addition`, wiring) | affected + new | changed files only |
| **refactor** | delta (what to preserve) | delta refactor plan | `refactor_extract` + `patch_apply` | **full suite** (invariants) | changed files only |
| **test** | coverage target | **SKIP** | `test_backfill` / `test_add` | new tests + full suite | test files only |
| **deps** | upgrade target list | dep-swap plan | `dependency_add` + adjacent-code patches | full suite + smoke | dep-diff + advisory |

**v1 specialization scope (per C6 cut).** Matrix cells are fully specified for the four "known"
intents (docs, bugfix, feature-extend, feature-new) because they map cleanly to the greenfield
behavior we already have. The three "new" intents (refactor, test, deps) route to the closest-
fitting known behavior in v1, with intent-specific prompt overrides landing in v1.5. This means
v1 ships all seven intents (surface-complete) with the last three at ~70% of full-specialized
quality; v1.5 tightens them.

**How the orchestrator branches.** After Gate 0 approval (which sets `intent` on the run
context), the orchestrator consults this table before each phase to decide: SKIP the phase, run
its default form, or run its intent-specific form. Skipped phases still emit a TelemetryEvent
with `phase: <name>, task_type: "skipped"` so downstream summaries stay complete.

**Skip semantics.**
- SKIP means the phase does not run at all — no packet dispatched, no artifact written, no gate
  fires for that phase. The gate immediately after a skipped phase is also skipped.
- Docs intent example: Phase 2 (architecture) skips → Gate 2 also skips → orchestrator goes
  straight from Gate 1 (requirements) to Phase 4 (packet planning).

---

## HITL gate prompt templates

**Subagent → main-loop bubble-up (all gates).** The orchestrator is a Claude Code subagent —
subagents don't run interactive dialogs. Every gate is delivered by the subagent returning a
message shaped as a fenced `> ⏸ **HITL Gate <N> — <Title>**` block (see templates below) that the
main-loop Claude Code session displays verbatim and waits for user input on. The user's reply
comes back to the subagent as a `{ gate_response: "approved" | "revise: <text>" | "abort" }`
argument on the next invocation. **Persist the gate-pending state to `.sdlc/local/state.json`
before emitting the message** — if the session dies mid-gate, session-hydrate detects a
non-terminal state and re-prompts on next `/mmo:brownfield` invocation. No new command needed.

### Gate 0 — Brownfield only, before Gate 1

On no, note in the final report so the user gets the same follow-up prompt that surfaced in the docs-gen v1 run.

On `approved`, freeze the write contract to `.sdlc/local/write-contract.json`
(schema: `{schema_version:1, active:true, mode:"brownfield", run_id, strict:true, allowlist,
off_limits}`). Build `off_limits` by concatenating `.sdlc/project.json.off_limits_default`
(the project-level constants — `.env*`, `.mcp.json`, `node_modules/**`, etc., written by setup)
with the AI-configs from `baseline.ai_configs_detected` and any ticket-specific paths the user
added at Gate 0. The PreToolUse hook and the packet validator both read the merged list — the
UX shrinks (Gate 0 doesn't re-ask about constants each ticket), the enforcement is unchanged.
See `plugin/scripts/write-contract-check.mjs` for the hook.

**Default the AI-coexistence answer to OFF-LIMITS.** A user who hits `approved` without reading
must not accidentally authorize the plugin to rewrite their `.cursor/rules` or their custom
`routing-policy.yaml`. If the user wants a competing AI config in scope, they must move it
explicitly.

## Telemetry contract (every LLM call)

Log via `log_telemetry` with `telemetry_path` = `<output_dir>/telemetry.jsonl`. Event shape:

```json
{
  "ts": "ISO-8601",
  "pass": "pass1|pass2",
  "phase": "<state>",
  "task_type": "<from packet>",
  "task_id": "<from packet>",
  "module": "<from packet>",
  "model": "<canonical model_name>",
  "routed_by": "orchestrator|fallback|manual",
  "routing": { "policy_name": "...", "policy_version": 1, "rule_index": 3, "rule_reason": "..." },
  "input_tokens": 1840,
  "input_tokens_cached": 1420,
  "output_tokens": 612,
  "cost_usd": 0.00234,
  "latency_ms": 1850,
  "success": true,
  "retry_count": 0,
  "artifact_path": "src/leave/leave.controller.ts"
}
```

For direct-tier calls (no MCP dispatch), the orchestrator constructs this event itself using the char/3.8 token estimator. **Do not populate `ts` or `latency_ms` for these — `log_telemetry` overwrites both server-side.** You have no clock and no stopwatch, so any value you supply is a guess; the server stamps the real arrival time and records `latency_ms: null`, meaning "not measured". A `0` would be read downstream as "returned instantly", and an invented `ts` corrupts the run duration in the manifest, which is derived by sorting events on `ts`. **Pricing constants come from the loaded policy YAML's `pricing:` block for the current model — never from the subagent's trained knowledge, never hardcoded.** If the policy's pricing block is missing, abort the run.
