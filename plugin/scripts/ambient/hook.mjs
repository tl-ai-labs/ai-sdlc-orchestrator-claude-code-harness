/**
 * Zero-touch hook dispatcher: one entry point for the hook moments zero-touch's workflow routing needs, in a chat the
 * zero-touch plugin marked at its start (no /mmo: command typed).
 *
 *   node hook.mjs <event>        hook input JSON on stdin, decision JSON on stdout
 *
 * What it does: a message the fixed rules recognise as one of the eight /mmo: jobs (lib/route.mjs) gets the
 * instruction to start that job's workflow (lib/route-flow.mjs); until the workflow starts, tools that change
 * something wait (Guard A, pre-any) and only that workflow's command may start (Guard B, pre-skill). Every other
 * message and every other tool call passes untouched: the chat is plain Claude Code.
 *
 * Hand-off mode (a chat the zero-touch plugin marked "b"; docs/ambient-mode.md, "Hand-off mode"): the chat's own
 * model does the development, so plain words start no workflow. A message asking for a new document, spec, plan,
 * tests or the same change across files is recognised by fixed rules (lib/handoff-route.mjs) and the chat's model is
 * reminded to hand that work to the hand-off tools; the person sees one line saying where the work goes
 * (lib/handoff.mjs). The chat is kept on its pinned model: a switch to another model is refused (pre-model-switch).
 * A workflow command the person types runs as in any chat.
 *
 * A second job while a workflow runs (lib/queue.mjs): plain words recognised as a job, or the model starting one,
 * are queued at once and said. A typed /mmo: workflow command is held, and the model asks the person "Queue it" or
 * "Replace it"; the answer is read from the multiple-choice result (post-question). A queued job starts by itself
 * at the end of the turn in which the running workflow finished (turn-end); a workflow that ended any other way
 * drops the queue. A replace stops the running workflow as mmo's own abort does (lib/workflow-log.mjs abortRun).
 * One workflow at a time per project (lib/project-lock.mjs).
 *
 * Contract held by every handler:
 *   - Decisions are JSON on stdout with exit 0. The shell shim in front of this file turns ANY exit into 0, so a
 *     crash here can never block a tool call or a prompt. No handler relies on exit 2.
 *   - A chat without the zero-touch mark returns before touching the disk (the shim, then lib/chat-mode.mjs).
 *     Mode "observe", a workflow run and a helper agent's call start nothing.
 *   - Modes: "on" is workflow mode, "b" is hand-off mode; zero-touch acts in both (acts()). "observe" only records.
 *   - No prompt text, file content or command output is ever stored. Paths, sizes, rule ids and numbers only.
