/**
 * Zero-touch hand-off mode, recognition half: which hand-off work a chat message asks for, or none
 * (docs/ambient-mode.md, "Hand-off mode").
 *
 * In a hand-off chat the chat's own model does the development. Five kinds of work go to the hand-off policy's model
 * instead, because each is mostly typing AND has a check that code can run on the result:
 *   docs    a new document of the project (a README, a guide, an API reference, a changelog)
 *   spec    a new spec (requirements, a design document, an API spec, a data-model write-up)
 *   plan    planning text (a plan, a task breakdown or tickets, a status report, release notes)
 *   tests   new tests for code that exists
 *   repeat  the same change repeated across files
 * Everything else (new code, a bug fix, a refactor, a question) stays with the chat's model.
 *
 * Fixed patterns, no model: the same message always gives the same answer. The message is read the way the workflow
 * recogniser reads it (lib/route.mjs: the first line's first sentence, polite openers removed, questions and
 * requests to explain set aside), then clause by clause. A clause is hand-off work when a creating verb opens it and
 * the thing it names IS one of the documents above, not something that merely mentions one: "add a changelog" is,
 * "add a changelog entry" and "add a section to the README" are edits to a file that exists and stay with the chat.
 * That is a grammar rule (the document word must close its noun phrase), not a list of exceptions.
 *
 * What this decides is the one line the person sees and the reminder the chat's model gets. The model can still hand
 * off work these patterns missed, and a new document typed by hand is refused by the hook whatever was recognised
 * here. So precision comes first: a wrong "this goes to the hand-off model" line is worse than a missed one. Unsure
 * is none.
 *
 * Unlike the workflow recogniser, a follow-up is fine here ("also add tests", "write tests for it"): nothing is
 * started, and the hand-off form makes the chat's model name the exact target.
