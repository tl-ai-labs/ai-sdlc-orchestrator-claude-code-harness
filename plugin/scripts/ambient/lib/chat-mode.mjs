/**
 * The chat's own on/off decision, taken once at its start (29 Sep 2026).
 *
 * Whether a chat has zero-touch is decided once, at the chat's start moment (SessionStart with source "startup", or
 * "clear", which begins a fresh conversation), and that answer is kept here for the whole chat; every hook moment
 * acts on it, and a change reaches new chats only. Read at different times, a setting changed in the middle of a
 * chat would leave it half on and half off (seen 29 Sep with 0.8.3, when a running chat's worker tools and its
 * start-of-chat note disagreed). A chat with no record (it started while zero-touch was off, or before the plugin
 * was installed) is off. The record is written by the zero-touch plugin itself, so that plugin is the switch
 * (below). A reopened chat ("resume") and a compaction keep the record they already have.
 *
 * The record is one small file beside the chat's other records: `sessions/<chat id>/chat_mode`, holding "on" or
 * "observe".

 * "off" removes it; "off" also wins at every other moment. No settings file takes part.
