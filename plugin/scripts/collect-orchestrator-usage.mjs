/**
 * collect-orchestrator-usage — reconstruct the run's OWN cost from session
 * transcripts and record it beside (never inside) the dispatched-work totals.
 *
 * The problem this closes: the orchestrator runs as a Claude Code session;
 * its own loop — reasoning, Read/Glob/Bash tool calls, re-sending the growing
 * conversation every turn — never passes through the MCP dispatch server, so
 * it is invisible to telemetry in BOTH auth modes. On real measured runs the
 * plugin reported $1.87 while the session transcripts summed to ≈$236: a
 * ~100× undercount, large enough to INVERT architecture comparisons drawn
 * from dispatched-only numbers. This tool sums the transcripts post-run and
 * appends one `tier: "orchestrator"` event to the run's telemetry, then
 * patches the manifest with an `orchestrator_overhead` block and a
 * `true_total_cost_usd` — leaving `total_cost_usd` dispatched-only, so the
 * two spends are never blended silently.
 *
 * Method, and the facts it rests on (verified against a real 52,985-line
 * session transcript before this tool was written, and re-verified for the
 * window and receipt rules against four real sessions across two CLI
 * versions in September 2026):
 *
 *   1. WHERE: transcripts live in ~/.claude/projects/<hash>/*.jsonl where
 *      <hash> is the absolute project path with every character that is not
 *      a letter or digit replaced by `-` (`/a/v0.6.0` → `-a-v0-6-0`); each
 *      session may also have <hash>/<sessionId>/subagents/*.jsonl.
 *      Driver subagents run in-session, so their transcripts count too — all
 *      in-session work is driver-tier work by construction (the plugin ships
 *      only the five driver agents).
 *   2. WHAT: every `"type": "assistant"` line carries `message.usage` with
 *      `input_tokens`, `cache_read_input_tokens`,
 *      `cache_creation_input_tokens`, `output_tokens` — and `message.model`.
 *   3. DEDUPE — the critical one: one API message is written as SEVERAL
 *      JSONL lines (one per content block), each repeating the same
 *      `message.id`. On the reference transcript 5,218 of 7,203 message ids
 *      appeared more than once — naive per-line summing roughly DOUBLES the
 *      cost, so each id is counted once. The usage on those lines is identical
 *      for input, cache_read and cache_write, but NOT for `output_tokens`:
 *      that is a partial snapshot, complete only on the message's terminal
 *      line — the one carrying `stop_reason`. Keeping the first line's value
 *      books a couple of tokens where the true figure is hundreds (measured
 *      2.85x low on a real run), so the terminal line's value is booked
 *      instead. A message with no terminal line (truncated, or still
 *      streaming) falls back to the largest value seen, which is a lower
 *      bound rather than a guess.
 *   4. EXCLUDE: `message.model === "<synthetic>"` lines are error
 *      placeholders fabricated by the CLI, not billed API traffic.
 *   5. WINDOW: run_id is NOT present in transcript metadata (checked
 *      empirically), but the run's own COMMAND TURN is: the `"type": "user"`
 *      line whose text invokes `/mmo:pass`, `/mmo:greenfield` or
 *      `/mmo:brownfield` (any plugin prefix; the orchestration runner's
 *      `ai-sdlc-*` command names too), carrying this run's `--run-id` or no
 *      run id at all. Claude Code bills PER INVOCATION, and an invocation
 *      begins at its human turn, so the window OPENS at that turn's own
 *      timestamp — exact, not approximate. The turn chosen is the latest one
 *      at or before the driver's `run.start` line in
 *      `<project-root>/.sdlc/runs/<run-id>/orchestrator.log` (else at or
 *      before the first dispatched event), preferring a turn in the receipt's
 *      own session and a turn naming this run id. The window CLOSES at the
 *      first human turn after the driver's `run.end` line (that turn starts
 *      the next invocation and is excluded), or at the end of the session
 *      file when no human turn follows — both exact, because assistant
 *      messages only ever follow a human turn. Lines with `isMeta: true`,
 *      `toolUseResult`, or a `tool_result` content block are the CLI's own
 *      bookkeeping, not human turns. Subagent files hold no human turns and
 *      are not scanned for them.
 *      FALLBACKS, each APPROXIMATE and said so: no command turn → the window
 *      opens at `run.start` minus 5 minutes (the driver's setup runs for a
 *      couple of seconds before it logs run.start), else at the manifest's
 *      `started_at` minus 5 minutes — `started_at` is the FIRST DISPATCHED
 *      event, not the driver's start, and opening the window there dropped
 *      7 messages and 22% of the driver's spend on a real run (v37-agsdk-1,
 *      2026-09-05). No `run.end`, or no pinned session file to read human
 *      turns from → the window closes at `run.end` plus 5 minutes, else at
 *      `ended_at` plus 5 minutes. An approximate window is labelled
 *      "approximate window" in cost_source and `window.exact = false` in the
 *      manifest, and the receipt rule (8) is what decides whether it was
 *      right — a wrong window fails that rule; it never writes a guess.
 *      One case is worse than approximate and says so: when the opening anchor
 *      is `started_at` (the first DISPATCHED call) the window cannot see what
 *      the driver did before it, so the overhead is a FLOOR, not an estimate —
 *      measured 22% low on v37-agsdk-1 and 83% low on a nested-window
 *      receivables fixture. That case reads "LOWER BOUND — window opens at the
 *      first dispatch" in cost_source and sets `window.lower_bound = true`.
 *      `run.start`/`run.end` are read as the LAST run.start at or before the
 *      first dispatch (a reused run id appends to the same log) and the first
 *      lifecycle marker after it, which must be run.end. File-level pruning
 *      uses mtime with a LOWER bound only (mtime < anchor − slack ⇒ the
 *      file's last write predates the run and it cannot contain run
 *      messages). There is deliberately NO mtime upper bound — a session
 *      that keeps going after the run would push mtime past the window and
 *      silently drop the run's own messages. This diverges from report.mjs's
 *      artifacts listing, which bounds mtime on both ends for a different
 *      purpose.
 *   6. PRICE: every counted message is priced on its own — its model
 *      (`message.model`, read with the price list's resolveModel), the UTC day
 *      of its timestamp, its own `usage.speed` / `service_tier` /
 *      `inference_geo`, and its own cache-write split
 *      (`cache_creation.ephemeral_5m_input_tokens` at the 5-minute write rate,
 *      `ephemeral_1h_input_tokens` at the 1-hour rate; a line without the
 *      split books its writes as 5-minute). Rates come from the dated price
 *      list, plugin/mcp/model-dispatch/src/prices.ts, which bills every
 *      dispatch too; a policy `pricing` block prices a model only under
 *      `pricing_override: true`, labelled custom. One rate for every token
 *      charged a Claude Fable 5.1 session with Opus 5 helpers at the Opus
 *      price. Streaming lines before a message's terminal line often omit
 *      `speed`, so each modifier is the value any line of the message
 *      recorded; two different values leave the message unpriced. A model,
 *      day or modifier value the list cannot price is never borrowed from a
 *      similar model: its tokens go to `unpriced[]` with the reason and stay
 *      out of the figure, the figure is labelled INCOMPLETE, and
 *      `--strict-pricing` refuses with exit 1. Messages are aggregated per
 *      model and role (`session` for a top-level session file, `helper` for a
 *      file under `subagents/`) into `per_model[]`, one entry per price, and
 *      the transcript figure is the sum of those entries. The policy's
 *      derived driver model now only labels the event.
 *   7. IDEMPOTENT: re-running replaces the prior orchestrator event for
 *      this pass (telemetry.jsonl is rewritten atomically without any
 *      `tier: "orchestrator"` lines, then the fresh event is appended) and
 *      re-patches the manifest. Run it as many times as you like.
 *   8. RECEIPT — the referee, when the run kept one: Claude Code's own
 *      end-of-session result (`claude -p --output-format json`, a runner's
 *      `claude-session.json`, or the last "result" line of a stream-json
 *      `live-run.log`; `--receipt <file>` overrides discovery and must
 *      exist). Its `modelUsage[model]` is Anthropic's token count for ONE
 *      invocation, and it includes calls Claude Code bills but never writes
 *      to a transcript. There is no percentage anywhere in the rule: the
 *      share billed but not logged was 2.3% and 22% on two real runs, so no
 *      fixed margin could be right. Per model and per token bucket:
 *      a. A receipt naming a session other than the command turn's: exit 3.
 *      b. NAMES are re-keyed on both sides by the price list's resolveModel
 *         id (resolveBucketNames), so the receipt's `claude-opus-5[1m]` is
 *         the transcript's `claude-opus-5`; verbatim names refused a real
 *         headless run (Sep 10 2026). A name the list cannot read is exit 3,
 *         printing both name lists: it is never paired by similarity.
 *      c. ABOVE — any transcript input, cache_read, cache_write or output
 *         bucket over the receipt, or a transcript model the receipt does not
 *         bill: the window holds messages the receipt never billed. Claude
 *         Code bills per invocation and a runner's `--resume` continuations
 *         each restart the bill, so when the pinned session file carries two
 *         or more human turns inside the window the LAST invocation alone is
 *         checked, every bucket equal (output at most): agreement writes the
 *         whole-window transcript figure as "transcript (receipt covers only
 *         the last invocation, verified; N earlier invocation(s)
 *         unverified)"; anything else is exit 3.
 *      d. AT OR BELOW on every bucket — the receipt is BOOKED as its token
 *         counts priced from the list (bookReceiptTokens), never as Claude
 *         Code's own dollars (its price table priced Opus 5 at Sonnet rates
 *         on Aug 24 2026). The logged part is priced per message (fact 6).
 *         The gap — receipt minus log per bucket, output included — is priced
 *         at that model's logged cache-write TTL and modifier mix; a model
 *         with no logged message (a CLI side call, a helper whose file is
 *         missing) at API-default modifiers with 5-minute writes unless the
 *         receipt's own top-level usage proves its split, every assumption
 *         written down. The gap is `unlogged_billed` {per_model, unpriced,
 *         cost_usd, pct_of_booked}, and the label is "receipt (Anthropic token
 *         counts priced at the price list); N% billed but not logged". A
 *         transcript EQUAL to the receipt on every bucket is the receipt's
 *         invocation by itself: every billed message writes a non-zero input
 *         or cache bucket, identical on each of its lines, so equal totals
 *         mean the same messages. A transcript BELOW it on some bucket is
 *         booked only when the window is PROVABLY the receipt's invocation
 *         (provableInvocation): pinned to the receipt's session, opened at
 *         the run's command turn, no later human turn, exact and not a lower
 *         bound. The gap is then calls Claude Code never logs, or a helper
 *         transcript that was not copied; `attribution_complete`
 *         (helperAttribution: every helper named by an Agent/Task result has
 *         its `subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`, and no such file is unnamed)
 *         tells those apart, and the total is right either way.
 *      e. BELOW without that proof: exit 3, nothing written — the gap may be
 *         billed messages outside the window (a subagent file not copied, a
 *         window that opened late).
 *      Claude Code's own dollars stay a check (`receipt_cli_usd`): more than
 *      RECEIPT_CLI_DRIFT (0.5%) from the booked figure is a NOTE. With a
 *      receipt but no transcript lines in the window, the receipt's token
 *      counts are priced the same way, every model receipt-only
 *      ("receipt-only (Anthropic token counts priced at the price list)").
 *      At run-end a headless live-run.log has no result line yet (the CLI
 *      writes it on exit): the figure is written transcript-priced and
 *      labelled "receipt pending; provisional", and a re-run after the
 *      session exits verifies it. Re-running is idempotent.
 *   9. IN-SESSION DISPATCH: packets the session executed itself (provenance
 *      `estimated` or `apportioned_from_measured_total`), and a `claude-cli`
 *      worker whose own `claude -p` session was swept into a transcript-priced
 *      scan, are already inside the overhead. Their dispatched dollars are
 *      subtracted once: true_total = dispatched − in-session + overhead. The
 *      subtraction is bounded by dispatched minus the out-of-session events
 *      (real vendor calls, never rewritten by any repair), restricted to
 *      models the manifest's `totals.models_used` names, classified by the
 *      event's `model_id` when present, and never applied to a claude-cli
 *      worker whose session was not scanned (receipt-booked figures, or a
 *      scan pinned to the driver's session). Measured +21% over the receipt
 *      without it. A claude-cli worker's event is billed from the same price
 *      list as this scan (its modelUsage tokens, TTL split from its own
 *      transcript), so the subtraction removes exactly what its swept-in
 *      session added and the net stays transcript-priced.

 *
 *   <pass-dir>          the run's output dir (holds manifest.json +
 *                       telemetry.jsonl), e.g. examples/<study>/passes/<run>
 *   --project-root      the repo the run was launched from. Defaults to the
 *                       current directory. This determines the transcript
 *                       location hash, so it must be the directory `claude`
 *                       ran in.
 *   --policy            policy name to price with. Defaults to the manifest's
 *                       `policy` (or `policy_name`) — the policy the run
 *                       actually used.
 *   --policy-path       explicit policy file; beats --policy and the
 *                       repo-local override, mirroring the server's loader.
 *   --transcripts-dir   read transcripts from this directory instead of
 *                       ~/.claude/projects/<hash> (tests; or a transcript
 *                       tree copied from another machine).
 *   --receipt           Claude Code's own end-of-session result for the driver
 *                       session: a `claude -p --output-format json` object, a
 *                       runner's `claude-session.json`, or a stream-json
 *                       capture (`--output-format stream-json > live-run.log`,
 *                       the headless recipe) whose last "result" line is read.
 *                       Defaults to <pass-dir>/claude-session.json, then
 *                       <pass-dir>/live-run.log, whichever exists.
 *   --strict-pricing    refuse (exit 1, nothing written) when any token in the
 *                       window, or any receipt token a booked receipt adds,
 *                       has no price on the list: an unknown model, no price
 *                       period for its day, or a speed / service_tier /
 *                       inference_geo value the list does not price. Without
 *                       it those tokens are listed in unpriced[] (or
 *                       unlogged_billed.unpriced) and the figure is labelled
 *                       INCOMPLETE.
 *   --dry-run           print everything, write nothing.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = event written (or --dry-run). 1 = bad arguments, missing
 * manifest, no billable assistant messages found in the run window (the
 * run WAS driven by a session, so an empty window means the wrong
 * project-root/transcripts-dir — nothing is written), or --strict-pricing
 * with a token the price list cannot price. 3 = the transcript and the
 * receipt cannot be reconciled — the transcript is over the receipt with no
 * continuation turn to account for the excess, or short of it in a window
 * that cannot be proven to be the receipt's invocation, or a model name on
 * either side is not on the price list, or the receipt names a session other
 * than the command turn's — nothing is written.

 * The per-bucket receipt comparison (header, fact 8), per model. `perModel` is the

 * for every model the transcript recorded, input, cache_read and cache_write
 * EQUAL the receipt's and output is AT MOST the receipt's. The caller decides
 * from the lists, not from `ok`: anything in `above` takes the ABOVE path,
 * and a non-empty `short` is booked only in a provable window. Why equality
 * is exact: every billed message carries at least one
 * non-zero count among input / cache_read / cache_write (a message with all
 * three at zero was never sent), and those three are identical on every
 * duplicate line of a message, so equal totals across all three mean the
 * same set of messages — a missing message lowers a bucket, an extra message
 * raises one, and the two cannot cancel across all three at once on any
 * transcript this tool has seen. Output alone may fall short: a message with
 * no terminal line books a partial snapshot. A receipt model with NO
 * transcript messages at all is the CLI's own side call (recorded on the
 * receipt, never in the transcript) and is reported, not failed; a
 * transcript model with no receipt entry is over the receipt.

// Identity — the run's id and policy name — is `buildManifest`'s INPUT, not its

// spellings are read first, then the dispatched lines, which each carry `pass`
// and `routing.policy_name`. No nested manifest key is read on purpose: adding
// them would be a list of model-invented names to keep extending, whereas the
// log's field names are written by code and cannot drift.
//
// THIS DOES CHANGE SOME ALREADY-PRICED RUNS, and the change is not cosmetic. A
// manifest with a readable top-level window but no id used to yield the literal
// pass `undefined`, and the command-turn scan skips any turn whose `--run-id`
// does not equal the pass — so the run's own invocation was skipped, the window
// fell back to the approximate ±5m anchors, and no session was pinned. Once the
// id resolves, that run pins its session and measures an exact window, and its
// dollars move. On one probe: $1.85 approximate becomes $1.55 exact. The new
// figure is the correct one, but anything already published from the old path
// must be re-collected rather than assumed stable — `orchestrator_overhead.window`
// records `source`, `exact` and `session_id` so the two are told apart.
//
// Orchestrator lines are skipped, exactly as the window skips them — but for a
// second reason. THIS SCRIPT writes an orchestrator line, and stamps its own
// `pass` and `routing.policy_name` into it. Reading those back on a re-run would
// make the collector's previous answer its next input: run it once with
// `--policy X` and every later run would silently re-price under X, with no
// manifest and no dispatched line ever having said so. The dispatched lines are
