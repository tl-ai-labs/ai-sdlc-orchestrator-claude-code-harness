/**
 * handoff-models: which model a policy gives each kind of hand-off work, in zero-touch's hand-off mode.
 *
 * In a hand-off chat the chat's own model does the development, and three kinds of work go to a policy's models:
 * documents, specs and planning text (the policy's `docs` stage), tests (its `tests` stage) and the same change
 * repeated across files (its `codegen` stage). The zero-touch hook asks this script once per chat, so the line the
 * person sees names the model that will really do the work, and the hand-off tools use that same answer.
 *
 * The models are derived by the SAME routing code the dispatch server uses (pickModel / loadPolicy from
 * ../mcp/model-dispatch/dist/, built before any run by verify-setup.mjs --fix or /mmo:setup), for the same reason
 * driver-model-check.mjs does: rule matching written a second time here could disagree with the real router. The
 * policy is read the way the executor reads it for a whole stage (executorView: a stage's files are routed by the
 * stage alone), which is how the hand-off tools read it too. MMO_SELECT slot choices are honoured the way the server
 * honours them.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node handoff-models.mjs --policy <name>          a shipped policy, by name
 *   node handoff-models.mjs --policy-path <file>     a policy file (a project's own routing-policy.yaml)
 *
 * Prints one line of JSON: { policy, routes: { docs, tests, repeat } }, each route { id, model, adapter }.
 * Exit codes: 0 = printed. 2 = the server is not built. 1 = the policy cannot be read or routed; the first line of
 * stderr says why.
