/**
 * The executor guard, two hooks in one file:
 *
 *   post — PostToolUse on execute_stage: records the calling helper's agent_id (Claude Code sends it on
 *          every hook call made inside a helper) in <project>/.sdlc/local/executor-agents.json, with the
 *          run's record folder (the folder of the spec_path the call named) and its code folder (the
 *          call's code_dir). Only an orchestrator running a greenfield executor run calls execute_stage.
 *   pre  — PreToolUse on Agent|Task|Write|Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit: when the caller is a recorded
 *          orchestrator, it may hire only the pipeline's own helpers (it reads a failing check's
 *          output itself and sends the files to change to execute_stage repair — never to
 *          general-purpose or Explore helpers on Opus), and it may write only inside its own run's
 *          record folder, never inside a code folder there (every change to the project's files goes
 *          through the typist, execute_stage repair, so the policy decides which model changes code). The allowed
 *          folder is the one the run named, not any `.sdlc` folder, so a `.sdlc` inside the product is
 *          not writable; a code folder inside the record folder (/mmo:pass writes its product to
 *          <record folder>/src) is not writable either.
 *
 * Why: diagnosis helpers and the orchestrator's own edits do the typist's work on Opus, outside the
 * policy's routing. The playbook forbids both; this makes it hold.
 *
 * Scope: only an orchestrator that called execute_stage. A brownfield run never does, so brownfield is
 * untouched; the main chat has no agent_id and is never touched. Fails open: an unreadable marker, a
 * missing field or any error allows the call — the guard never breaks a session.
