/**
 * Brownfield write-contract PreToolUse hook.
 *
 * Refuses Write/Edit against paths outside the confirmed allowlist when
 * brownfield mode is active. Silent no-op when no active contract file
 * exists — that keeps greenfield /mmo:greenfield and non-plugin editing
 * behaviour unchanged.
 *
 * Contract file: <repo-root>/.sdlc/local/write-contract.json
 *   { schema_version, active, mode, run_id, strict, allowlist, off_limits }
 *
 * The orchestrator writes/updates this file after Gate 0 approval and
 * clears it (sets active:false) when the run closes. See plan §4 / §26.
 *
 * Fail-safe philosophy: any bug in this hook must NOT block user work.
 * Parse failures, missing fields, unresolvable paths — all allow. The
 * only denials are on known off-limits or non-allowlist matches when the
 * contract file itself parses cleanly and is active.
 *
 * Exit codes (Claude Code hook contract):
 *   0 → allow
 *   2 → deny (Claude Code blocks the tool call and feeds stderr back to
 *       the model as the reason). Exit 1 is NOT a deny: the hook contract
 *       treats 1 as a non-blocking hook error — the message is surfaced
 *       but the write still goes through, making every denial advisory.
