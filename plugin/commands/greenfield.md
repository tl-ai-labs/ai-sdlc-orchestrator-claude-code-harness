description: "Run the AI-SDLC pipeline against a project brief. Takes no arguments — asks for whatever it needs, checks the setup before spending anything, and reports tokens and cost per phase when the run finishes."
argument-hint: ""
---

Run one full AI-SDLC pass. This command takes no arguments. Everything it needs it asks for.

Work through the steps in order. Do not skip a step because the answer seems obvious, and do not
start the run until step 5 is confirmed.

# 0. Mode-detection guard — greenfield only

**Before anything else,** check the current directory. This command is the **greenfield** entry
point — it generates a whole new application from a brief into `./src`. If the user is standing in
an **existing repo** (any of the signals below), they almost certainly want `/mmo:brownfield`
instead, and running greenfield here would treat their real code as an empty canvas.

Signals of an existing repo:
- `./src/` exists and is non-empty
- `.git/` exists with any tracked files (`git ls-files | head -1` returns a file)
- `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, or another stack manifest exists at repo root
- `README.md` exists and is longer than a stub (>200 bytes)

If any of these hold, **stop and offer the choice** before continuing:

> This looks like an existing repo, not an empty folder.
>
> - **`/mmo:brownfield`** is for extending an existing project — pick one of seven job types
>   (docs / bugfix / feature-extend / feature-new / refactor / test / deps), confirm scope at
>   Gate 0, and run with a write contract that guarantees your existing files stay untouched.
> - **`/mmo:greenfield`** (this command) will treat this folder as the target for a fresh generated
>   application. That may not be what you want.
>
> Which do you want to run? (`brownfield` / `run --force-greenfield` / `abort`)

Only proceed with the rest of this command if the user replies `run --force-greenfield` or
explicitly confirms they want greenfield in this folder. If they reply `brownfield`, exit and
tell them to run `/mmo:brownfield` in their next turn.

# 1. Check the setup before anything else

Run the setup check that ships with the plugin:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/verify-setup.mjs"
```

Read its exit code, not just its output.

- **Exit 1** — the plugin cannot run. Show the user the reported problems and their fixes. If the
  problem is a missing dependency or an unbuilt server, offer to run the same script with `--fix`,
  which repairs both. **Stop here.** Do not start a run that will fail partway through and bill the
  user for the phases before the failure.
- **Exit 0 with warnings** — the run can proceed, but some policies cannot. Carry the warnings into
  step 4, where they decide which models are actually reachable.
- **Exit 0, clean** — continue.

# 2. Find the brief, or write one

The pipeline builds what a brief describes. Look for one in this order and stop at the first hit.

**a. A brief in the current directory.** Search for markdown files whose first heading begins
`# Project Brief`. If exactly one exists, name it and ask the user to confirm it is the right one.
If several exist, list them and ask which.

**b. A brief the user names.** If the user has a brief elsewhere, ask for the path and read it.

**c. A brief that ships with the plugin.** Offer the three shipped examples, described in one line
each so the choice is meaningful. Say plainly how long each takes, because the difference is
minutes versus hours and the user is paying for it. All three paths are inside the installed
plugin, not the working directory — the user is typically standing in an empty folder, where no
repository file exists:
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/examples/quick-demo/brief.md` — a one-endpoint ping service on Express,
  no database. The one to pick to see the pipeline end to end: minutes, not hours, and a fraction
  of the cost.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/examples/workforce-ops/brief.md` — HR and workforce operations: employees,
  time entries, leave approval, reporting, with encrypted PII and role-based masking. Five modules;
  expect an hour or more.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/examples/travel-ops/brief.md` — travel booking operations: fare rules,
  holds, cancellation and refund computation, an append-only ledger, with encrypted traveller PII.
  Five modules; expect an hour or more.

Copy the chosen file to `brief.md` in the current directory before running, so the run record sits
beside the brief it was built from and the user can edit it for a second pass.

**d. No brief anywhere — write one.** This is the normal case in an empty folder. Interview the
user and write the brief for them. Ask, in plain language and one at a time:
1. What are we building, and who uses it?
2. What are the main areas of functionality? Push for concrete capabilities, not categories —
   "approve a leave request and debit the balance" produces better work than "leave management".
3. What must be true everywhere — validation, logging, authentication, audit?
4. What technology stack, if the user has one in mind? If they do not, propose the stack the
   shipped examples use and let them accept it.
5. What is explicitly not in this build?
6. How will they know it worked? Push for checks someone can run.

Write the answers into the section layout below, save it as `brief.md` in the current directory,
show it to the user, and get their approval before continuing. The brief is the single input to
everything downstream — a vague brief produces vague software, and the user cannot tell the
difference until the run has finished and the money is spent.

The requirements phase and the `architect` subagent read these headings by name. The wording under
each is up to the author, but the set is fixed:

```
# Project Brief — <project name>
## One-line summary
## Business context
## Scope                        (one `### 1. <Module name>` per bounded slice, capabilities bulleted)
## Cross-cutting requirements
## Tech stack (fixed)
## Non-functional
## Explicitly OUT of scope
## Acceptance criteria
```

Either shipped example in step 2c is a filled-in instance of this layout; read one if a section's
expected depth is unclear.

# 3. Confirm where the output goes

Unless the user says otherwise:

- Generated application code → `./src`
- Run record — telemetry, manifest, packets, reports → `./.sdlc/`

Tell the user both paths. If `./src` already contains files, say so and ask before writing into it.

# 4. Show what will run

State the routing plainly, as fact. Read the policy name written by setup:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup-policy.mjs" --print-only
```

This prints the `default_policy` field setup wrote to `.sdlc/project.json`. If the output is
empty, setup wasn't run for this project — stop and tell the user to run setup first
([SETUP.md](../../SETUP.md), §5b). Do not proceed to spend anything without a policy the user
has explicitly picked or explicitly kept as the shipped default.

Resolve the policy through the `load_policy` MCP tool, passing `policy_name: <resolved-name>` and
`project_root: $(pwd)`. Do **not** read the preset YAML from
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/policies/` yourself: the loader's precedence puts a repo-local
`<project root>/routing-policy.yaml` ahead of the named preset, and reading the preset file
directly is exactly the bug that made greenfield preview one policy while the run priced under
another. Passing `project_root` here means the preview and every later dispatch resolve through
the same loader and can never disagree.

The plan preview must state which policy file won and where it came from — one line, e.g.
`Policy: project override (routing-policy.yaml)` or `Policy: preset opus-plus-flash` — so a
surprise override is visible before anything is billed. To tell the two apart, check whether
`<project root>/routing-policy.yaml` exists: if it does, the loader used it.

Report, in a short list:
- which model handles the judgment phases — requirements, design, task planning, senior review,
  security review
- which model handles the mechanical phases — codegen, tests, docs, debug
- the per-million input and output rates the policy declares for each, so the user can see where the
  cost difference comes from

**Say which door the mechanical tier goes through, and only if it is the unusual one.** That tier
can be reached two ways: as a model call, which is the default, or as an Antigravity agent that
works in the folder directly. If `MMO_SELECT` names `flash-agsdk-worker`, this install has chosen
the agent — say so in one sentence, and say that it costs several times more per task than the same
model called directly, because an agent re-sends the conversation on every tool call. The rates
above are unchanged and still true; what changes is the token count. Add one more sentence, because
it is the thing that makes the extra spend inspectable rather than merely claimed: the run will
leave a `delegation/` directory beside the telemetry, holding the brief each worker was given and a
receipt for what it did, and the end-of-run report will carry a **Delegated to an agent worker**
section naming every delegated packet. Do not raise any of this when
`MMO_SELECT` is unset, which is the normal case — an unexplained aside about a path they are not
on is noise, not transparency.

**Offer the two-cent probe, on that path only, and only if they have not run it.** Pre-flight
constructs the agent's adapter but never calls it, so three things stay unknown until the first
delegated packet: whether the project carries the Antigravity entitlement, whether the region
serves the model, and whether the credentials are still valid. All three fail *after* requirements,
design and task planning are billed to the premium tier. Say that in one sentence and offer to run
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/probe-agent-worker.mjs` first — one trivial delegation, about two
cents, and it exits 0 or names the cause in words. If they decline, continue; the run is not
blocked on it.

This command runs whatever `project.default_policy` resolves to. To change it for this project,
the user re-runs setup — `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup-policy.mjs"` opens the
browser-based policy console and writes the new choice to `.sdlc/project.json`. Do not launch
the console from this flow; setup owns it.

If step 1 reported missing Gemini credentials, say so here and explain the consequence in one
sentence: the mechanical phases cannot dispatch, so the run would fail at the first codegen packet.
Offer to continue on `opus-only` instead, which routes every phase to Claude and needs no Gemini
credentials — and say plainly that it costs more, because the cost saving comes precisely from the
phases that would have gone to the cheaper model.

# 5. Choose the telemetry mode, out loud

The run records tokens and cost in one of two modes. Present the choice; do not decide silently.

- **Vendor** — every call goes through the bundled server, and the numbers are the ones the vendor
  reports. Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Use this whenever the numbers will be shown to anyone.
- **Estimated** — the judgment-phase tokens are estimated from character counts. No API key needed;
  a Claude Code subscription covers the run. The mechanical-phase numbers are still vendor-reported.
  This mode also requires `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` to have been exported before `claude`
  launched, set to the policy's driver model — the orchestrator's run-start check stops the run
  otherwise and prints the exact export line, because the driver subagents execute whatever that
  variable names while the policy only prices the work.

If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, recommend vendor and say why: the numbers reconcile against the
console. If it is absent, recommend estimated and say what is lost: the judgment-phase figures are
approximations, so do not publish them as measurements.

Then confirm the whole plan in one short summary — brief, output paths, policy, telemetry mode —
and get a yes before starting. This is the last free moment; everything after it costs money.

# 6. Run

Invoke the `orchestrator` subagent with the resolved settings from the steps above:

- `brief_path` — the confirmed brief
- `auth_mode` — `vendor` or `estimated`, as confirmed in step 5
- `policy` — the resolved policy name from step 4 (`project.default_policy` or `opus-plus-flash`)
- `code_dir` — `./src`
- `output_dir` — `./.sdlc`

The orchestrator pauses at four approval gates: after requirements, after design, after the security
review, and before final acceptance. Relay each gate to the user as it arrives; do not answer them
on the user's behalf.

# 7. Report

When the run finishes, show:
- tokens per phase, split into cached input, fresh input, and output
- cost per phase and the run total
- which model each phase ran on, so the routing is visible rather than asserted
- where the generated code and the run record were written

Then stop. Do not propose follow-up runs.
